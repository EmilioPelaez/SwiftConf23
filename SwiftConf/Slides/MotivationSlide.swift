"""
The motivation for this talk is that one of the earliest challenges developers run into is how to send data between two components in an application
It's such a common challenge that we develop whole architectures to solve it
There's lots of opinions on how it should be done
But I'm not here to convince you to use or not use a specific architecture
Instead we're going to explore the tools available out of the box in SwiftUI
We're also going to find interesting ways of using them
