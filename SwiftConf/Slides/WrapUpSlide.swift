All the views in a SwiftUI app are connected to each other through the view hierarchy or view tree
This view hierarchy has multiple communication channels that we can leverage to share data and messages between any two views in our application
The environment and preference channels are very flexible and modular, but that comes at the cost of not having compile-time safety
