Obviously there's no rule that our closures have to be synchronous
By adding an environment value that contains an async closure, we can create a way to fetch remote resources
I'm going to create a simple one for loading images
Now, my view can execute this task and fetch the image
Because we are using a responder chain, we can add more responders that will try to serve the event first
For example, we can add a responder that will look for the image in the asset catalog
